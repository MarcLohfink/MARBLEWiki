The Import panel provides an easy way to import supported models into the Creator and thus into Unity.

## Navigate to import

Navigate to the "Import" menu item in the Creator. A window opens where you can import models to use with MARBLE (see below).
You will see the following labels and options:

## Overview
| Label | Content |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| **polygon count warning** | For the best and most stable results only use models with around 100k polygons|
| **supported file extensions** | At the moment you can only import .obj models with the importer. All other unity supported files have to be imported manually.|
| **add subfolder destination** | Use this to create a folder in which all the models will be imported to. The models will still be independently imported in their own subfolder. |
| **Import** | Will import the selected .obj either to the default import path or the default import path + subfolder.  |
| **Import all** | Will get all .obj files of the selected directory and import them either to the default import path or the default import path + subfolder.  |

Beaware that this can take some time.
After successful import, the models can be integrated into the seminars.

## Subfolders
The subfolder text area is a quick way to import models into a specific subfolder, e.g. if you want to group all models under a specific term. Nevertheless, each model gets its own folder, named after its model name, where all related files are stored.
If this is not your first time entering a subfolder, you will be prompted to do so. Select "Do not bug me again!" to avoid being bothered with the prompt again.

## Location for advanced users
The default import path is _"Assets/Models/\_User/Models/\*Subfolder\*"_.

## WhatÂ´s Next?
After the model is imported, it can be used in the "Edit Showcase Model" window.
