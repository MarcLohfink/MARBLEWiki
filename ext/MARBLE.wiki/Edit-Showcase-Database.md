A showcase database is a collection of models which can be used in a session/ seminar and are packed into a package when exporting a project.



# Pitfalls
<img src="https://github.com/FUSEEProjectTeam/MARBLE/blob/StateServiceProfileRestructure/M/Assets/_MARBLECreator/Data/Images/Warning_Texture.png" width="10" /> Do not over do it. Do not put every model for every session/ seminar into one database. This is not the intention of the underlying design.
<br/><img src="https://github.com/FUSEEProjectTeam/MARBLE/blob/StateServiceProfileRestructure/M/Assets/_MARBLECreator/Data/Images/Warning_Texture.png" width="10" /> Do not add "pin loops". Every database needs one start model from which all pins/ details can be accessed. Do not reference this model in another model.
